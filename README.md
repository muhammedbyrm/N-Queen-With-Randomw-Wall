# N-Queen-With-Randomw-Wall
Modified version of N-Queen. In this problem there is a random wall in each column. In normal chess, the queen can take-over any item in a horizontal, vertical, and diagonal direction. But this checkboard contains walls that limit this behavior.

Code need optimization for both DFS and Hill Climbing. Also there is a simple problem in Hill Climbing, currently it cannot put a two queens in the same row even there is a wall between them, you need to fix it.
